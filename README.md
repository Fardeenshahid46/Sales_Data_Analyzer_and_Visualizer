This project is focused on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Python’s powerful libraries, Pandas and Matplotlib. The dataset used contains records of sales transactions, including the date of sale, product category, and revenue generated. The first step involves loading the CSV file and converting the 'Date' column into datetime format to enable proper time-based analysis.

The project then performs two key analyses. First, it calculates the total revenue generated by each product category using group-by operations, and visualizes the results in a clear and informative bar chart. This helps in identifying which categories are the highest revenue-generators, making it useful for product performance assessment. Second, it computes the daily revenue trend by grouping the data by date and plotting it as a line graph. This visualization helps in understanding how revenue changes over time, revealing patterns, peaks, and potential low-performing days.

Both visualizations are saved as image files for reporting purposes. Overall, this project demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful business insights using data processing and visualization techniques. It’s ideal for businesses, analysts, or decision-makers who want to monitor sales performance, track growth, and make informed strategic decisions.
